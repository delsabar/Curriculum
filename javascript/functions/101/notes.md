# Javascript Functions 101
## A general overview

### Terms

**Annonymous function**


**Argument**
A hardcoded value passed into a function when it is executed.
In the example, `"John"` in between the parentheses is the argument.
```
greeting("John")
```

**Call**
An action which executes (or fires) the function.

**Callback function**


**Function**
There are 2 contexts. One is the function definition itself. Another is the code within the definition which executes when called and which sometimes returns a value.

**Function body**
Contains the code of the function itself within a set of `{}`.

**Function decleartion**
Uses the _function_ keyword to declare a named function. The name of the function immediately follows the _function_ keyword.
```
function greeting() {
    return `Hello, you sure look nice today.`;
    }
```

**Function expression**


**Hoisting**


**IIFE**


**Named function**


**Parameter**
A placeholder whose value equals the argument passed into the function when it was called. This value is accessed only within the function itself.
In the example, `name` inside of the parentheses is the parameter.
```
function greeting(name) {
    return `Hello ${name}, you sure look nice today.`;
    }
```

**Parentheses**
The parentheses have two purposes. One is the execute a function. Another is part of the syntax to define a function. In the former, it may conatian arguments. In the latter, it may contain parameters.

**Return**
If implemented, it executes the last line of a function's code. It precedes a data type or a collection to be returned. We say that a function closes or exits when the code that follows _return_ executes which also means that any lines beneath it are ignored.

**Scope**
Refers to what values are available in memory at a given time during the execution of code.
